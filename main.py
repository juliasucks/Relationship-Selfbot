I like how we have late night conversations and how much you care about me and waited for me. I see us having a future but there is stuff that I need to work on in our relationship like communicating but I just dont want to put stuff on you when Im upset or bother you about it. its not your fault, and I don’t want to lose you, and you’re not boring im just dry sometimes because I just quick respond. Some stuff kinda bothers me like when you say i love you without capsulizing it, just seems like you don’t mean it, or like when you say “if you want me to” when I ask something, because it comes off like you dont want to and im forcing you to. Its just little stuff that bothers me that shouldn’t, I just over think stuff. I see a lot in you like how much of great boyfriend you are and you always show me a lot attention and make my day better:two_hearts:. But don’t say you’re boring because if anything im boring I barely respond most the time and I feel bad for it because you deserve better and ill try to talk to you more**')
